# Creating a Retail Edge Fleet

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

- `Retail Edge` allows you to quickly create Kubernetes clusters running `k3d` in `Azure VMs`
- These cluster are intended for learning, dev and test
- For secure or production clusters, we recommend [AKS Secure Baseline](https://github.com/mspnp/aks-baseline)

## Prerequisites

- Required Learning
  - Go through the Kubernetes in Codespaces inner-loop hands-on lab [here](https://github.com/cse-labs/kubernetes-in-codespaces)
  - Repeat until you are comfortable with Codespaces, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Fluent Bit, Grafana, K9s, and our inner-loop process
    - Everything is built on this
- Recommended Learning
  - Go through the GitOps Automation [Quick Start](https://github.com/bartr/autogitops)
    - Repeat until you are comfortable
      - GitOps is built on this

## Click on `Use this template` and create your GitOps repo

- Only clone the main branch
- Additional instructions reference your new GitHub repo, not this repo

## Verify ci-cd

- Open the `Actions` tab in your repo at GitHub.com
  - The action needs read / write permission
  - You may have to change your default permission
    - Settings
      - Actions
        - General

## Create a Codespace

- Create your Codespace from your new repo
  - Click on `Code` then click `New Codespace`

Once Codespaces is running:

> Make sure your terminal is running zsh - bash is not supported and will not work
>
> If it's running bash, exit and create a new terminal (this is a random bug in Codespaces)

## Validate your setup

> It is a best practice to close the first shell and start a new one - sometimes the shell starts before setup is complete and isn't fully configured

```bash

# check your PAT - the two values should be the same
echo $AKDC_PAT
echo $GITHUB_TOKEN

# check your env vars
flt env

# output
# AKDC_GITOPS=true
# AKDC_PAT=yourPAT
# AKDC_REPO=yourRepoTenant/yourRepoName

```

## Set Flux repo and branch

- Edit `apps/flux-system/autogitops/config.json`
  - Set `fluxRepo` and `fluxBranch`
  - Git commit and push

## Login to Azure

- Run `az login --use-device-code`
  - Select your subscription if required

## Check availability of VM SKU in Azure region

```bash

# default azure region is centralus
az vm list-sizes -l yourLocation -o table | grep -e Standard_D4as_v5 -e Standard_D4s_v5

```

## Create a single cluster fleet

- ` flt create -c your-cluster-name --verbose`
  - do not specify `--arc` if you are using a normal AIRS subscription
  - do not specify `--ssl` unless you have domain, DNS, and wildcard cert setup
  - specify `--verbose` to see verbose output
  - if VM SKU is not available in default region (centralus), specify `-l yourLocation` to create cluster in different region

## Update your GitOps repo

```bash

# you should see new files from ci-cd
# if you don't, check the Actions tab
git pull

# add and commit the ips file
git add .
git commit -am "added ips file"
git push

```

## Check setup status

> flt is the fleet CLI provided by Retail Edge / Pilot-in-a-Box
>
> The `flt check` commands will fail until SSHD is running, so you may get errors for 30 seconds or so

- Run until you get a status of "complete"
  - Usually 4-5 min

```bash

# check setup status
flt check setup

```

## Check your Fleet

```bash

# list clusters in the fleet
flt list

# check heartbeat on the fleet
# you should get 17 bytes from each cluster
# if not, please reach out to the Platform Team for support
flt check heartbeat

```

## Deploy the Reference App

- IMDb is the reference app
- Normally, the apps would be in separate repos
  - We include the reference app in this repo for convenience
  - Heartbeat and Istio are `bootstrap services` and should be in this repo

```bash

cd apps/imdb

# check deploy targets (should be [])
flt targets list

# clear the targets if not []
flt targets clear

# add your cluster as a target
flt targets add yourClusterName

# deploy the changes
flt targets deploy

```

## Check that your GitHub Action is running

- <https://github.com/yourOrg/yourRepo/actions>
  - your action should be queued or in-progress

## Check deployment

- Once the action completes successfully

```bash

# you should see imdb added to your cluster
git pull

# force flux to sync
# flux will sync on a schedule - this command forces it to sync now for debugging
flt sync

# check that imdb is deployed to your cluster
flt check app imdb

# curl the IMDb endpoints
flt curl /version
flt curl /healthz
flt curl /readyz

```

## Delete your test cluster

```bash

# change to the repo base dir
cd $REPO_BASE

git pull

flt delete yourCluster

## you can skip these steps if you're deleting the repo

# delete your cluster config & deployments
rm ips
rm -rf config/yourClusterName
rm -rf deploy/apps/yourClusterName
rm -rf deploy/bootstrap/yourClusterName
rm -rf deploy/flux/yourClusterName

# commit and push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -am "delete cluster config & deployments"
git push

```

## Create a multi-cluster Fleet

- We generally group our fleets together in one resource group
- An example of creating a 3 cluster fleet
  - this will create the following meta data which can be used as targets
    - region:central
    - zone:central-tx
    - district:central-tx-atx
    - store:central-tx-atx-801

  ```bash

  flt create -g my-fleet \
    -c central-tx-atx-801 \
    -c east-ga-atl-801 \
    -c west-wa-sea-801

  ```

## Setup your GitHub PAT

> GitOps needs a PAT that can push to this repo
>
> You can use your Codespaces token but it will be deleted when your Codespace is deleted and GitOps will quit working

### For production, you want to use a service account instead of your individual account

- Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) in your GitHub account
  - Grant repo and package access
  - You can use an existing PAT as long as it has permissions
  - <https://github.com/settings/tokens>

- Create a personal Codespace secret
  - <https://github.com/settings/codespaces>
  - Name: PAT
  - Value: your PAT
  - Grant access to this repo and any other repos you want

## Setup your Azure Subscription

- If you plan to use Azure Arc
  - Request a `sponsored subscription` from AIRS
- Additional setup is required
  - Contact the Platform Team for more details
    - domain name
    - DNS
    - SSL wildcard cert
    - Managed Identity
    - Key Vault
    - Service Principal
